1.  In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be

integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

*        ................expression

'hello'  ................value

-87.8    ................value

-        ................expression

/        .................expression

+        .................expression

6        ..................value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

String: String is just text ,it is type of informetion, it can be written in quotes such: "ahmead", 'ahemad'

Variable: Variable is a store of information

3. Describe three different data types.

List: sing of list is [] , it is used for storing multiple data items in a single variable.

Integer: integer can store only numerical values.

Float: float can store only floating values such as 1.2,1.3,1.4 etc.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Expression is made up of values,mathematical operators, containers,  e.g

     a = 2 + 3

expressions are used to evaluate the values or represent the result on the screen.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

expression is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler
to create a new value,
Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators
and
the statement is just like a command that a python interpreter executes like print.it doesn't return anything

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?

bacon = 22

bacon + 1

Sol: print (bacon + 1)
it gives 23


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

7.1 'spam' + 'spamspam'
sol : spamspamspam

'spam' * 3
sol : spamspamspam
sol: it will be the same


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Ans: we can not start giving variable an integer name.
we should begin with, a string-like alphabet name then integer.
e.g.  a100 is valid

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

ans: int()
     float(),
     str()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'

sol: 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings
     if we have to concatenate it we need to convert 99 to string like "99"
     print('I have eaten' + "99" + 'burritos')
